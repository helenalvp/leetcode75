## Question
> Given an array of integers __nums__ and in integer __target__, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to **target**_.
>  
>  You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
> 
> You may return the answer in any order.
>  
>  **Example 1:** 
>  ```
>  Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
>  Output: [0,1]
>  Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0,1]
>  ```
>  **Example 2:** 
>  ```
>  Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
>  Output: [1,2]
>  ```
>  **Example 3:** 
>  ```
>  Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
>  Output: [0,1]
>  ```
>  
>  **Contraints:** 
>  - ``` 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4```
>  - ``` -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
>  - ``` -10^9 <= target <= 10^9```
>  - ** Only one valid answuer exists **
>  
>  **Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n<sup>2</sup>) time completely?
